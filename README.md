FocusFlight

A personal productivity app inspired by the “study flight” concept.
Choose a route, set the duration of the flight, and stay focused until you “land.”
Built for my personal use across iOS, Android (via Expo Go), and the web.

🚀 Tech Stack

React Native (UI)

Expo (development framework & cross-platform tooling)

TypeScript (strong typing)

Expo Go (run instantly on my phone without a full build)

Web Support using Expo’s web renderer

AsyncStorage (local on-device storage for sessions, no backend)

GitHub for version control + project tracking

🎯 Project Goal

Create a lightweight, private focus app that:

Lets me pick origin, destination, and study duration

Runs a clean, distraction-free countdown timer

Logs each completed “flight”

Tracks total hours, number of flights, and personal streaks

Works on both my phone and laptop seamlessly
