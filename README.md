                   **FOCUSFLIGHT**


A personal focus app inspired by “study flights.”
Pick a route, set a duration, and stay locked in until you land.
Built only for my personal use — fast, simple, cross-platform.

**TECH STACK**
- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- Expo Go (for instant iOS/Android development)
- Expo Web (runs in a browser too)
- AsyncStorage (local on-device storage)
- Git + GitHub (version control)


**GOAL**

Create a lightweight app that:
- Lets me choose origin, destination, and flight duration
- Runs a clean, distraction-free timer
- Logs each completed “flight”
- Tracks total hours, flights, and daily streaks
- Works on both my phone and laptop with one codebase


**HOW TO RUN**
1. Install Expo Go on your phone.
2. Start the dev server:
       npx expo start
3. Scan the QR code (phone) or press 'w' (web).


**STATUS**

Project just started.
Expo project initialised and ready for building the UI + logic.
