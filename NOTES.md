# UI Notes

- Background: dark navy / charcoal for cockpit / night flight feel.
- Primary accent: single bold color (teal or amber) for buttons and highlights.
- Secondary accent: soft gray/blue for supporting elements.
- Typography: big bold numeric timer; smaller, lighter text for labels.
- Corners: slightly rounded (not full pills).
- Overall mood: calm, serious, “pilot mode,” not cartoony.
